# Website-Chicago-Blues-Grave-Tour
Over the summer, I wrote a book called: Flowers For Chicago Blues: A Grave Tour. Recently, I turned the book into a website: 

https://chicagobluesgravetour.com

Flowers For Chicago Blues, which has yet to be published, honors twenty-one of the greatest Blues artists buried in the Chicagoland area. The reader travels through eleven cemeteries. Each set of carnations and roses were placed upon the graves by me. They are coordinated to fit the artistâ€™s style. The website consists of 33 HTML pages, 38 JPG images, a CSS page, and JavaScript. The book/website is a culmination of the last seven years of studying Chicago Blues and visiting these artists gravesites. My intention with the website is to show how these artists shaped and molded American Popular Music as we know it today.
