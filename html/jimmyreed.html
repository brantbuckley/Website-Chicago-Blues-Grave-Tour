				<p>Jimmy Reed, Mathis James Reed, was born September 6th, 1925 in Dunleith, Mississippi. A Chicago Bluesman 
				known for cool hypnotic effortless rhythms, he was one of the first musicians to play harmonica and guitar 
				at the same time. Also, he’s known for his deceptive V chord. Jimmy Reed crossed the Blues over and had hit 
				songs on the Billboard charts. He had more records on Billboard’s Hot 100 than any other Blues artist. “Baby 
				What You Want Me To Do”, “Big Boss Man”, “Bright Lights, Big City”, “Honest I Do”, and “You Don’t Have To Go” 
				were all hits. Elvis Presley, John Mayer, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Hank Williams Jr., Van Morrison, and 
				Steve Miller have covered his music. The way the Rolling Stones swing and sway is all Jimmy Reed. Throughout his 
				career Reed suffered from alcoholism and d.t.’s, delirium tremens; seizures and hallucinations caused by alcohol deprivation. 
				This was a major cause and reason for Reed canceling gigs. In 1957, he developed epilepsy from his alcoholism. On 
				August 29th, 1976 Jimmy Reed died in his sleep while on tour in Oakland, California. The death certificate read postictal 
				respiratory failure most likely due to a grand mal seizure. Honorary pallbearers at his funeral included Muhammad Ali, 
				Muddy Waters, Bobby Blue Bland, B.B. King, and John Lee Hooker. Steve Miller said of Reed, “The music definitely broke 
				down barriers way before the law did or Martin Luther King did. Guys like Jimmy Reed were making people think. A lot 
				of people weren’t thinking of it in terms of race and segregation, they weren’t thinking about it at all, except they 
				liked the music and danced to it and they got down to it.” Jimmy Reed is buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, 
				Illinois.
