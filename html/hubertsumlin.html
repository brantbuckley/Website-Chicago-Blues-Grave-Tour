				<p>Hubert Sumlin was born November 16th, 1931 in Greenwood, Mississippi. He was a Chicago Bluesman and 
				guitar player for Howlin’ Wolf.  Known for his rhythmic riffs and solo’s, he created the music for “Smokestack 
				Lightnin’,” “Killing Floor,” and “Goin’ Down Slow.” He created a new electric sound by playing with his 
				fingers instead of using a guitar pick. Hubert Sumlin influenced Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, and Jimmy Page. 
				Before there was Mick & Keith or Lennon & McCartney, there was Sumlin & Wolf. Sumlin was a necessary force for 
				Howlin Wolf’s sound and created a new Chicago Electric Blues riff style. In 1954, Hubert Sumlin moved to Chicago. 
				He recalled, “As soon as I got there, man, Wolf had everything in Chicago sewn up. He had it all. He was playing 
				every night.” In March of 1954, Hubert made his first recordings with Howlin’ Wolf including “No Place To Go,” 
				“Rockin’ Daddy,” “You Gonna Wreck My Life,” “Neighbors,” and “I’m The Wolf.” Just a few months after his initial 
				recordings, he recorded hits “Evil” and “Baby How Long.” In 1956, he recorded the legendary riff to “Smokestack 
				Lightning.” The 1960’s were good to Hubert Sumlin. He played guitar on Howlin’ Wolf’s following tracks: 1960’s 
				“Spoonful,” 1961’s “Shake For Me,” and 1964’s “Killing Floor.” After Howlin’ Wolf died in 1976, he played with 
				the remaining band members. He called the group The Wolf Gang, playing with them until 1980. In 2008, he was inducted 
				into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame. Hubert performed at Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2004, 2007, and 2010. 
				He was nominated for four Grammy awards (1999, 2000, 2006, and 2010) but never won. Sumlin died from heart failure December 4, 
				2011 in Wayne, New Jersey. Keith Richards and Mick Jagger paid for his funeral. Hubert Sumlin is buried at Washington Memory 
				Gardens in Homewood, Illinois.
