				<p>Jimmy Rogers, real name James A. Lane, was born June 3rd, 1924 in Ruleville, Mississippi. He was 
				an excellent side man, master of musical subtlety and finesse, and he accompanied Muddy Waters. As a 
				Chicago Blues solo artist, he achieved success with “That’s All Right” and “Walking By Myself.” His songs 
				have been covered by Canned Heat, Freddie King, Magic Sam, and Johnny Winter. Throughout his career he played 
				with Muddy Waters, Little Walter, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and 
				Taj Mahal. He played with Muddy Waters’ band until 1954 and played on Muddy’s classic recordings “I’m Your 
				Hoochie Coochie Man”, “Mannish Boy”, “I Just Want To Make Love To You”, “I’m Ready”, “Baby Please Don’t Go”, 
				“Blow Wind Blow”, and “Screamin’ And Cryin’.” Jimmy Rogers achieved success as a solo artist for Chess Records 
				with his 1950 song “That’s All Right” and 1956 hit “Walking By Myself.” This was beyond rare for a side man. In 
				the 1960’s, he gave up music completely and worked at a clothing store and drove taxis. In 1982, he resurrected 
				his career and performed live until his death. In 1994, he played “Walking By Myself” on Late Night With Conan 
				O’Brien and was interviewed by O’Brien. In 1995, Jimmy was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. He died December 19, 
				1997 in Chicago from colon cancer after surgery from an intestinal infection. Harmonica player Kim Wilson was a 
				pallbearer at the funeral. Jimmy Rogers is buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.
