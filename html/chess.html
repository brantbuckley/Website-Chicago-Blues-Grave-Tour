				<p>Leonard Chess, real name Lejzor Szmuel Czyz, was born March 12th, 1917 in Motal, Poland. He created 
				Chess Records in Chicago and recorded the greatest Blues artists of the 20th century in part creating Chicago 
				Electric Blues. Chess Records artists included Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Chuck Berry, Howlin’ Wolf, Little 
				Walter, Willie Dixon, Bo Diddley, Buddy Guy, Etta James, and Koko Taylor. Waters said of Leonard, “The first 
				was that a friendship developed between Leonard Chess and myself for which I wouldn’t take a million dollars. 
				Here was a guy who had blind faith. He didn’t believe in my Blues but believed in me as a person when we 
				started out. I got a big kick out of proving myself to him as a performer. I got more of a kick out of the 
				fact that we became more than business associates, real intimate friends. I tell everyone who asks that the 
				one person responsible for my success is Leonard.” In 1969, with dwindling record sales and dealing with the 
				ever-changing music industry, Leonard wanted to pursue radio and television. He sold Chess Records to GRT 
				(General Recorded Tape). On October 16, 1969 he died from a heart attack while driving his car. He was 52. 
				At the funeral, Muddy Waters wept and said “It’s all over, Leonard.” Leonard Chess is buried at Westlawn Cemetery in 
				Norridge, Illinois.
