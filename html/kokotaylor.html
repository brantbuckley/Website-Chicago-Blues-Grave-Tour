				<p>Koko Taylor, real name Cora Anna Walton, was born September 1928 in Shelby County, Tennessee. Called 
				“The Queen Of The Blues,” she was a Chicago Blues singer known for her growling gritty deep vocals. She 
				was a successful Blueswoman in a male dominated industry. Her recording “Wang Dang Doodle” sold over a 
				million copies. Throughout her career, she worked with B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Buddy Guy, 
				Junior Wells, Robert Plant, and Jimmy Page. After she impressed Willie Dixon one night at a club with her 
				singing, she was signed to Chess Records. In 1966, “Wang Dang Doodle” was released featuring Buddy Guy on 
				guitar. The song was a hit and reached number four on Billboard’s R & B chart. Also, the song was written by 
				Willie Dixon. Howlin’ Wolf recorded a prior and less successful version of the song in 1961. In 1967, at The 
				American Folk Blues Festival a live version of “Wang Dang Doodle” was recorded featuring Little Walter on 
				harmonica and Hound Dog Taylor on guitar. Her future recordings never achieved the success of “Wang Dang Doodle” 
				and she rarely charted again. In the 1960’s and 1970’s she toured the United States and gained popularity. 
				In 1975, she signed to Alligator Records and recorded nine albums for Alligator. Koko’s Alligator albums include: 
				1975’s “I Got What It Takes,” 1978’s “The Earthshaker,” 1981’s “From The Heart Of A Woman,” 1986’s “Queen Of The Blues,” 
				1987’s “Live From Chicago,” 1992’s “Jump For Joy,” 1993’s “Force Of Nature,” 2000’s “Royal Blue,” and 2007’s “Old School,” 
				Throughout her career, she won twenty-nine W.C. Handy Blues Music Awards. In 1989, she survived a brutal car crash. On March 3, 
				1993 Chicago Mayor Richard Daley declared it to be “Koko Taylor Day” and she was inducted into The Blues Foundation’s Hall Of Fame 
				in 1997. She received the Blues Foundation’s Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. Also, Koko Taylor appeared in the Blues Brother’s 
				2000 film and performed on Late Night With Conan O’Brien and Late Night With David Letterman. She even performed at The 
				Kennedy Center Honors to honor Morgan Freeman. May 7th, 2009 was her final performance at The Blues Music Awards. She died June 3rd, 
				2009 in Chicago after complications from surgery due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Koko Taylor is buried at Washington 
				Memory Gardens in Homewood, Illinois.
