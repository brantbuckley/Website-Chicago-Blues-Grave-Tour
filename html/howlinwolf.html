				<p>Howlin’ Wolf, real name Chester Arthur Burnett, was born June 10th, 1910 in White Station, Mississippi. 
				Known for his wolf moon howling vocals, the Chicago Bluesman was a towering powerful figure who played guitar 
				and harmonica. He had Billboard charting music. His songs "Smokestack Lightnin’,” “Killing Floor,” “Little Red 
				Rooster,” and “Spoonful” are all Blues standards. Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, Cream, Eric 
				Clapton, Etta James, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, Dave Van Ronk, and Soundgarden covered his music. Recently, 
				Wolf’s song, "Smokestack Lightnin’,” was featured in Martin Scorsese’s 2013 film Wolf of Wall Street. In 1959, Howlin’ 
				Wolf released his first full album, Moanin’ In The Moonlight. It is regarded as one of the greatest Blues records of 
				all time. In 1960, he recorded “Spoonful” and in 1964 he recorded “Killing Floor.” He received worldwide exposure in 
				1965 when he appeared with the Rolling Stones on the T.V. program Shindig. In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, his 
				health rapidly declined. He suffered multiple heart attacks and injured his kidneys in a 1970 car crash. As so many 
				Blues musicians felt and experienced, Wolf too felt he missed reaching his full potential. “I wished it could have been better” 
				and “Somehow or other, though, it just wasn’t for me to have the breaks that other people had.” In 1972, he received 
				an honorary doctorate from Columbia College in Chicago. In 1976, he underwent brain surgery for a brain tumor.
				He died January 10th, 1976 in Hines, Illinois due to complications from the procedure. His heart gave out. Eric Clapton 
				paid for Wolf’s tombstone. That night, after he was laid to rest, a full moon lit and filled Chicago’s landscape. 
				Howlin’ Wolf is buried at Oakridge Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.
