				<p>Big Bill Broonzy’s history is clouded by mystique and uncertainty. What remains certain is he was one 
				of the greatest Acoustic Country Blues guitar players of all time. Born William Lee Conley Broonzy, he told 
				people he was born June 26th, 1893 in Scott, Mississippi. After extensive research, Robert Reisman concluded 
				he was most likely born June 26th, 1903 in Jefferson County, Arkansas. He first learned to play violin in 
				Arkansas and performed at local churches. Bill learned Spirituals and Folk Songs from his uncle. While in 
				Scott, Mississippi he played country fiddle at picnics and local parties. Eric Clapton spoke of him in his autobiography, 
				“The main man for me was Big Bill Broonzy, and I tried to learn his technique, which was to accompany yourself with your thumb, 
				using the thumb to play to play eighth notes on the bass strings while you pick out a riff or countermelody with your fingers. 
				This is a staple part of Blues playing in one form or another and can be developed into a Folk pattern, too, like clawhammer, 
				where you move your thumb rhythmically between the bottom strings alternately while picking out the melody on the top strings 
				with your first, second, and sometimes third fingers.” Clapton connected with Broonzy’s “Hey Hey” and “Key to The Highway” and 
				recorded both. Muddy Waters, Jerry Garcia, Ron Wood, Keith Richards, Tom Jones, Steve Howe, and Ray Davies were all influenced 
				by Big Bill Broonzy. Big Bill Broonzy died from throat cancer in 1958 and his exact death date remains uncertain. He passed away 
				on either August 14th or 15th. A recording of his song “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” was played at his funeral prompting newspaper 
				headlines: “Broonzy Sings At Own Funeral.” Muddy Waters, Otis Spann, Sunnyland Slim, and Tampa Red were pallbearers at 
				Big Bill’s funeral. Big Bill Broonzy is buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island, Illinois.
