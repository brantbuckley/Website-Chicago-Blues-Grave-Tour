				<p>Junior Wells’ birthplace is unknown. He was born Amos Wells Blakemore Jr. December 9th, 1934 in West Memphis, 
				Arkansas or Memphis, Tennessee. A Chicago Bluesman and harmonica player, he was the James Brown of the Blues. 
				Known for wearing flashy stylistic clothing, his singing and harmonica playing was sharper and tighter than 
				his dress. His signature song “Messin’ With The Kid,” recorded in 1960 in Chicago, featured Earl Hooker on 
				guitar. In 1966, he re-recorded a second version of the song featuring Buddy Guy on guitar. The song has been 
				covered by Muddy Waters, Rory Gallagher, The Blues Brothers, Freddy King, Kid Rock, and Buddy Guy. Guy recounted 
				wanting to play with Wells. “I kid him a lot about the difference in our age but he had played with Muddy and Walter 
				and them before I came here and he had experience that I wanted and I didn’t have.” Also, Mick Jagger said of Wells, 
				“Junior was a great harp player. He was one of my influences, along with Little Walter and Sonny Terry.” Junior’s 1960 
				song “Little By Little” was a hit and reached 23 on the Billboard R & B Chart. The song’s been covered by B.B. King, 
				John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers, Charlie Musselwhite, Gregg Allman, and Susan Tedeschi.  In 1974, Junior released “On Tap.” 
				In 1975, he released two live albums: “Live at Yuhbin-Chokin Hall” and “Live at Theresa’s.” He continued touring and recording 
				throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s. Records included “The Original Blues Brothers,” “Universal Rock,” “Chiefly Wells,” “Harp Attack,” 
				and “Undisputed Godfather of the Blues.” He appeared in the movie Blues Brothers 2000 which was released in 1998. Being treated 
				for lymphoma, Well’s had a heart attack and died January 15th, 1998 in Chicago. Junior Wells is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Chicago, 
				Illinois.
