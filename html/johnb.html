				<p>John Belushi was born January 24th, 1949 in Chicago, Illinois. An entertainer, actor, musician, and 
				comedian he created The Blues Brothers with Dan Aykroyd. The duo developed their act on NBC’s Saturday Night 
				Live. Their debut album, Briefcase Full of Blues with Atlantic Records, sold three and a half million records 
				making it the highest selling Blues album of all time. The Blues Brothers movie brought Chicago and Blues music 
				to the forefront in a new never before seen way and ignited and resurrected the dormant careers of John Lee 
				Hooker, James Brown, Ray Charles, and Aretha Franklin. In 1975, he received his big break after being casted in 
				NBC’s Saturday Night. Aykroyd was a Blues music inspiration for Belushi as Dan developed his musical career at Le 
				Hibou Coffee House in Ottawa, Canada and saw Muddy Waters (he played drums behind him once), Otis Spann, Howlin’ Wolf, 
				Buddy Guy, and Junior Wells. In 1978, The Blues Brothers made their television debut and performed on Saturday Night Live. 
				Dan Aykroyd spoke of the band’s origins. “The Blues Brothers look came from a lot of things. One was an old John Lee Hooker 
				album cover. He had the hat and the shades. We also had this philosophy that these characters were rebels. They were bad guys. 
				They weren’t morally evil or spiritually bad; they were just bad in terms of the law, and they had to play it straight, hence 
				the whole Lenny Bruce thing of going onstage wearing a thin tie and looking like an FBI agent, just to present that 
				conventional, legitimate look to the straight people out there. When John did the Shelley Bayliss character on SNL – that 
				1950’s hipster comedian – that was when the suit and the glasses first appeared. And technically, the first Blues Brothers 
				number ever was the “King Bee” song done in the bee costumes.” Paul Shaffer was instrumental in helping Belushi and Aykroyd 
				find the right bandmates. “Before we hired Matt Murphy, I got John to promise that we’d find a rhythm guitar player, too. Blues 
				guitarists aren’t always good rhythm players.” In 1978, they recorded Briefcase Full of Blues. The album was recorded live while 
				they opened for Steve Martin at Los Angeles’ Universal Amphitheater. The album went number one on the Billboard 200. In June 1980, 
				The Blues Brothers film was released along with the soundtrack. The film was a success and grossed over one hundred and fifteen 
				million dollars worldwide. The soundtrack and the band’s second album, The Blues Brothers: Original Soundtrack Recording, had a Billboard 
				Top 20 hit with “Gimme Some Lovin’.” The band’s third album, Made in America, was recorded live only a few months after the film’s 
				release again at Los Angeles’ Universal Amphitheater. The album made the Billboard top 50. Belushi struggled with addiction throughout his 
				life and died March 5th, 1982 in Los Angeles from a drug overdose. He was thirty-three. He is buried at Abel’s Hill Cemetery in Chilmark, Massachusetts 
				on Martha’s Vineyard. John Belushi has a cenotaph, memorial marker, next to his mother’s grave at Elmwood Cemetery and Mausoleum in River Grove, 
				Illinois. It is said that he was at one time buried at Elmwood Cemetery and Mausoleum.
