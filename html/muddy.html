				<p>McKinley Morganfield, known as Muddy Waters, was born April 4th, 1913 in Issaquena County, Mississippi. 
				Recognized for his searing electric slide guitar work and powerful expressive vocals, Muddy may be the most 
				important Chicago Bluesman of all time. He created, shaped, and molded Electric Blues. He is the man who 
				literally invented musical electricity, meaning, he took Southern Delta Acoustic Country Blues and electrified 
				and amplified it in a brand new and revolutionary way. In Muddy’s words, “I think I’m responsible for Chicago’s 
				Blues. I think I’m the man that set Chicago up for the real Blues.” Also, Muddy was one of the rare Bluesmen who
				had chart topping hit songs and a collection of well-known tunes. “I’m Your Hoochie Coochie Man”, “I’m Ready”, 
				“Honey Bee”, “Just Make Love To Me”, “Mannish Boy”, “Long Distance Call”, “Louisiana Blues”, “Got My Mojo Working”, 
				and “Rollin’ Stone” all made the Billboard Rhythm & Blues charts and were played heavily on the radio. The late 
				1940’s and 1950’s (1948-1958) was Muddy’s time. He was on fire during this time period and he single handedly raised 
				the price on records in Chicago. “They were selling records then for seventy-nine cents, something like that. They 
				went up to dollar ten. I raised the price on it.” The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, and all other groups 
				blasting out of the British Invasion owe a huge thanks and exist because of Muddy Waters. The Rolling Stones Mick Jagger 
				and Keith Richards named their band after Muddy’s song “Rollin’ Stone.” Muddy Waters died from cardiorespiratory arrest 
				and carcinoma of the lungs on April 30, 1983 at his home in Westmont, IL. He is buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, IL. 
				Muddy Waters remains one of the most important musicians of the twentieth century.
