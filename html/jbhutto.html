				<p>Chicago Bluesman J.B. Hutto, real name Joseph Benjamin Hutto, was born April 26th, 1926 in Blackville, 
				South Carolina. An Elmore James disciple, Hutto was known for his shimmering gritty slide playing and authentic 
				high-pitched vocals. He was called the king of the slide. Interviewed in the 1972 film, Chicago Blues Documentary, 
				Hutto said on Blues, “It dropped out of sight for a while. I don’t know what happened. But then all of a sudden it came 
				back. Cause everybody left the Blues and went for Rock & Roll. I mean if you couldn’t do the thing you know you had nothin’ 
				going for ya. I don’t know why. If you don’t play the Blues now then you got nothin’ going for ya now, ya know. You gotta 
				be able, honestly, to play a little all of it. A little Rock, a little Roll, a little Blues. [What would you rather play?] 
				Me? Blues. That’s right off the bat. Blues. I’m a Bluesman.” He died of carcinoid cancer June 12th, 1983 in Harvey, Illinois. 
				He was fifty-seven. Throughout his career he was known for playing his red Montgomery Ward Res-O-Glas Airline guitar popularized 
				by Jack White. J.B. Hutto is buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.
