				<p>Sunnyland Slim, real name Albert Luandrew, was born September 5th, 1906 near Vance, Mississippi. Known 
				for his Blues piano expertise, unique falsetto howls, and helping up and coming musicians, he was one of 
				Chicago’s most in demand piano players. He started Muddy Waters’ recording career. Muddy said, “He’s a 
				good person. Always was. He’s the goodest person you could meet.” Primarily a sideman, he played with 
				Ma Rainey, Honey Boy Edwards, Tampa Red, Big Bill Broonzy, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Water, and 
				the original Sonny Boy Williamson. In 1987, he received Chicago’s Gold Medal of Merit onstage in front of 
				100,000 people. In 1988, he received the National Heritage Fellowship Award from the National Endowment. 
				On March 17th, 1995 he died from renal failure, kidney failure, in Chicago. Sunnyland Slim is buried at 
				Mount Vernon Memorial Estates in Lemont, Illinois.
