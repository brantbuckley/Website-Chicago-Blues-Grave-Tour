				<p>Otis Spann’s birthdate is unknown. He was born either March 21st, 1924 or 1930 in Belzoni or Jackson, 
				Mississippi. A Chicago Bluesman, excellent side man, and impeccable piano player, he played with Muddy Waters, 
				Eric Clapton, Chuck Berry, Little Walter, Howlin’ Wolf, Sonny Boy Williamson, Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and 
				Johnny Shines. On Otis’s playing Muddy Waters said, “There is no one left like him who plays real, solid 
				bottom Blues like he does. We’d better raise another before it’s too late.” Otis Spann played on Waters’ most 
				important songs including “Hoochie Coochie Man”, “I’m Ready”, and “Got My Mojo Working.” Also, he recorded as 
				a solo artist for Chess Records in 1954 releasing “It Must Have Been The Devil.” B.B. King played guitar on the 
				track. He worked with Eric Clapton and Muddy Waters on the British label, Decca and James Cotton on the Prestige 
				Label. On April 24th, 1970 Otis Spann died at Cook County hospital in Chicago from liver cancer. Harmonica player 
				Charlie Musselwhite spoke about Otis’s funeral. “I remember walking by Muddy’s car at Spann’s funeral. He [Muddy Waters] 
				had the window rolled down, looked really, really sad. I said, “It’s a sad day.” He said, “Yeah, it is.” We shook hands 
				through the window. And that’s all we said. Everybody loved Spann. He was just drenched in Blues. He was the Blues walking 
				and talking.” In Buddy Guy’s autobiography, he recounted, “But when Muddy showed up with Otis Spann, that really opened up 
				the door to what people were calling Chicago Blues.” Otis Spann is buried at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, IL.
