				<p>Theodore Roosevelt, known as Hound Dog Taylor, was born April 12th, 1915 in Natchez, Mississippi. An 
				Elmore James disciple, Taylor was known for his open tuned slide guitar playing. Hound Dog was the most 
				unique, eccentric, and unusual of all the Chicago Bluesman. He marched to his own beat and operated from 
				his own unique musical time. His free-spirited extreme stompin’ Boogie Woogie up tempo slide jams must have 
				made John Lee Hooker proud. The way George Thorogood and The Destroyers swing and vibe is directly sourced 
				from Hound Dog Taylor. George spoke about being influence by Taylor. “I saw Hound Dog Taylor and that did it. 
				That pushed me over the line. That said, “Well if you’re going to make a statement in this business, you’re 
				going to have to get off that acoustic guitar. Playing with the electric guitar and a bass player and a 
				drummer, that just felt more natural to me.” Early AC/DC vocals pulled from Hound Dog Taylor and the Young 
				brothers overdriven guitars were heavily influenced by him. Hound Dog Taylor was a lifelong heavy smoker and died on 
				December 17th, 1975 from lung cancer. He was quoted many times throughout his life saying, “When I die, they’ll say 
				“He couldn’t play shit, but he sure makes it sound good!” Hound Dog Taylor is buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.
