				<p>Sam Gene Maghett, known as Magic Sam, was born February 14th, 1937 in Grenada County, Mississippi. As 
				good a guitar gunslinger as Earl Hooker, he was a unique Chicago Blues creative force. “Magic Sam’s Boogie” 
				may be one of the most inventive and revolutionary instrumental electric guitar tracks of all time. A masterful 
				lead guitar player, he brought fresh new harmonies to the Blues and he could make his guitar sound like a 
				rhythmic drum. Blues writer, promoter, photographer, and former manager Dick Waterman said of Sam, “One thing 
				I didn’t mention in the book is a player named Magic Sam who died at the age of thirty-two. I think Sam was brilliant. 
				He died in 1969. If he had done an album every other year from 1969, I think he would have been one of the all-time 
				great Chicago Bluesmen.” Magic Sam followed up “West Side Soul” with his second Delmark release “Back Magic” in 
				November 1969. On December 1st, 1969 Magic Sam’s career was cut short when he died from a heart attack. He was 
				only thirty-two. Right before his death, Bob Koester planned on releasing him from Delmark Records to Stax Records. 
				Stax Records was a Blues, Soul, and Gospel label based in Memphis, Tennessee. Its biggest artists included Otis Redding, 
				Booker T & The M.G.’s, Albert King, and The Staple Singers. To think what Magic Sam would have done with Stax Records 
				if he had lived. Magic Sam is buried in Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.
