				<p>Kansas Joe McCoy born Wilbur McCoy May 11th, 1905 in Raymond, Mississippi was a Delta Blues guitarist, 
				songwriter, and singer. He was known for his sweet-sounding vocals and thumpin’ groovy resonator guitar tone. 
				His songs have been covered by Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, John Mellencamp, and Ella Fitzgerald. Growing up, he 
				taught himself to play guitar with his younger brother Charles McCoy (Papa Charlie McCoy). They played picnic 
				parties around Jackson, Mississippi. Kansas Joe moved to Memphis, Tennessee and was a regular in the music 
				scene throughout the 1920’s. He teamed up with Memphis Minnie, real name Lizzie Douglas, an accomplished Blues 
				singer and songwriter. In 1929, they recorded “When the Levee Breaks” in New York City, a song about Mississippi 
				flooding. The song went all but unnoticed. In 1971, Led Zeppelin recorded and popularized the song. It appeared 
				on their fourth album alongside “Stairway to Heaven.” Kansas Joe McCoy died from heart disease January 28th, 1950 
				in Chicago. He was only forty-four. Soon after, his brother Papa Charlie McCoy passed away. Kansas Joe McCoy is 
				buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.
