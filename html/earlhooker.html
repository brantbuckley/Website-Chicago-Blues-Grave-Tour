				<p>Earl Hooker was born January 15th, 1930 in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Of all the Chicago Bluesman, he 
				may have been the most gifted and talented electric guitar player. Known for his genius Blues riff runs, 
				intricate solo lead lines, superb slide playing, and flamboyant yet contained stage presence which included 
				playing with his teeth and behind his back, he never received the full recognition he deserved. He was a 
				master technician. Buddy Guy said of Earl, “No way I could compete with guitarists of the day. I’m talkin’ 
				bout Earl Hooker, the greatest slide man in the history of slides. No guitarist in his right mind wanted to 
				tangle with Earl.” As a master sideman he played and worked with just about everyone in the business including 
				Ike Turner, the real Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter, Sam Cooke, and James Brown. 
				Leonard Chess, owner of Chess Records, loved Earl’s instrumental song “Blue Guitar.” He heard the song’s hit potential 
				for Muddy Waters and had Willie Dixon write lyrics for the song. It was renamed “You Shook Me.” Chess hired Earl to 
				record a few more instrumentals for Muddy Waters. One of his instrumentals turned into “You Need Love” for Muddy. 
				Again, Willie Dixon wrote the lyrics. Led Zeppelin recorded successful versions of both songs. For Zeppelin, “You 
				Need Love” turned into “Whole Lotta Love.” In 1969, he played twenty concerts in twenty-three days for The American 
				Folk Blues Festival in Europe. Upon arrival in Chicago, he was completely burnt out and soon after was hospitalized. 
				He died from tuberculosis on April 21, 1970. He is buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. Earl Hooker was a 
				musical genius, a musician’s musician, and ahead of his time.
