				<p>Sammy David Lawhorn was born July 12th, 1935 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Known as a master guitar sideman, 
				he played full time in Muddy Waters’ band for close to ten years. A staple in the Chicago Blues world, he 
				accompanied the following musicians: Otis Spann, Junior Wells, John Lee Hooker, Big Mama Thorton, James Cotton, 
				Eddie Boyd, and Koko Taylor. His cool smooth guitar licks easily filled in space making him one of the most 
				sought after and in demand side men. “All my life, the guitar has been my only inspiration; I know my instrument 
				and I can make it say anything I want it to, everything that I feel. When I hear a guy playing, I don’t care about 
				the style of his music, what I love is the guitar’s sound, its strength.” Sammy Lawhorn died April 29th, 1990 in Chicago 
				from natural causes. He was 54. Contributing factors included arthritis from broken bones from his third story fall and 
				alcoholism. He is buried at Restvale Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.
