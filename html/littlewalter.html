				<p>Little Walter, real name Marion Walter Jacobs, was born May 1st, 1930 in Marksville, Louisiana. He was 
				an innovative creative Chicago Blues force known for his amplified unique harmonica sound and was a sideman 
				in Muddy Water’s band. Muddy said of Walter, “I had the best harmonica player in the business… Little Walter… 
				set the example for the world in harmonica playing.” Little Walter’s songs “Juke” and “My Babe” were smash hits 
				for Chess Records and he revolutionized the harmonica. Between 1952-1958 he had fourteen top ten hits on the 
				Billboard R & B charts. “My Babe” has been covered by Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Steve Miller, 
				Solomon Burke, Ike & Tine Turner, Johnny Winter, and The Everly Brothers. In the late 1950’s, Walter’s crazy, 
				wild, gambling, drinking, womanizing ways were getting the best of him. Success had gone to his head, violent 
				altercations, and trouble with the law were becoming the norm. He toured Europe twice in the 1960’s. Upon 
				returning from 1967’s American Folk Blues Festival, Walter was involved in an altercation in Chicago and was 
				hit in the head. It’s claimed he was either hit in the head by the brother of one of his girlfriend’s or hit 
				in the head with a lead pipe over a gambling dispute. He died in his sleep February 15th, 1968 in Chicago. 
				He was thirty-seven. His death certificate stated the cause of death was due to a blood clot in his heart. 
				Little Walter is buried at St. Mary’s Catholic Cemetery in Evergreen Park, Illinois.
